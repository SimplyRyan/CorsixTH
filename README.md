## Developers - 
### Coders and non-coders we want you!

We are always looking for help with improving CorsixTH. The code base is made up for LUA and C++/C with most of the logic of the game written in LUA (we love LUA) hit fork and get started. But don't worry if you don't code as we can always use help with translation, level creation, art or improving the wiki! If you have ideas for the project please contact us!
